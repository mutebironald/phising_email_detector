## Data Description
Phishing emails are a growing threat to people and organizations across the globe. These emails are designed to deceive recipients into sharing sensitive information or taking harmful actions. Detecting and stopping phishing emails is essential for protecting both personal and financial security. Recently, machine learning has shown great potential in helping to fight this problem.

The dataset contains the text from emails, which can be analyzed to identify phishing attempts. By applying machine learning techniques to these email texts, we can classify and detect phishing emails more effectively.

## Steps:
 - loaded and cleaned dataset
 - Created Univariate visualisations (wordcloud for phising and non-phising emails, Email length distributions)
 - Added multivariate visualisations(sentiment analysis, Email length Versus Word Count)
 - Classical ML modal with logistic regression
 - Created a Feedforward Neural Network
