# Phishing Email Detection

## Goal
This project aims to detect phishing emails using machine learning and neural network techniques to improve security by identifying deceptive email content.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails).

### Hosted Notebook
The project notebook is available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JPKBHAHOHaA6lFj63GRfcMeuNg5mlRT8?usp=sharing).

## Data Description
Phishing emails pose a significant threat worldwide by attempting to trick recipients into sharing sensitive information or taking harmful actions. Detecting and stopping these emails is essential for both personal and financial security. Recently, machine learning has shown great potential in helping to combat this issue. This dataset provides email text samples that can be analyzed to identify phishing attempts, and machine learning techniques allow for effective classification and detection.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loaded and preprocessed the dataset to prepare for analysis.
2. **Univariate Visualizations**: 
   - Created word clouds for phishing and non-phishing emails.
   - Analyzed email length distributions.
3. **Multivariate Visualizations**:
   - Conducted sentiment analysis.
   - Plotted Email Length vs. Word Count.
4. **Classical Machine Learning Model**: 
   - Built a logistic regression model for initial classification.
5. **Neural Network Model**:
   - Developed a Feedforward Neural Network to enhance detection capabilities.
